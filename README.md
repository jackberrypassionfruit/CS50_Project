You will then be taken to our homepage. You may click on your profile to see your progress to date or the activities button to get start on solving some quadratics. The activies are split into two difficuleits - easier and harder. Within these there is a teacher's page which allows a teacher to just run through the process of solving a quadratic equation, a students page which offers a guided walkthrough of the method, and a test page which allows students to have a go without any guidance. 

As students work on the students page and the test page, their progress is recorded on their profile page.
