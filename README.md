Upon loading the heroku app, you will be taken to a login page of our math activity website. Click register in the top right to create an account and log in.
 
You will then be taken to our homepage. You may click on your profile to see your progress to date or the activities button to get started on solving some quadratic equations. The activities are split into two difficulties - easier and harder. Within these, there is a teacher's page which allows a teacher to just run through the process of solving a quadratic equation, a students page which offers a guided walkthrough of the method requiring structured input from the student, and a test page which allows students to have a go at randomly generated problems without any guidance.
 
As students work on the students page and the test page, their progress is recorded on their profile page.
 
The main idea for the use of this website is in classroom mathematics teaching, the idea being that a teacher would explain conceptually the method of solving a quadratic equation with the use of the teacher pages to run through the steps. Then, students would be able to practice independently with the structured practice pages, and finally, when more confident, they can test themselves with no support using the test page.
