We built our project with the "finance" problem set as a model. Thus we have similar login, homepage, acitivies and profile pages in our website which we will explain below.

Login: Students are prompted to log in after which their login details including hashed passwords are stored in our first sql table. 

Acitvities: Students then have the chocie of activities to complete. The 6 pages follow a fairly standard formuala - the roots of a randomly generated quadratic function are passed to HTML pages using jinja. The pages then use javascript to unveil sequentially the steps required to solve the equations when they equate to zero. The steps are presented in HTML. For the teacher versions, as the javascript adds and reveals the new steps, the solutions to each step are automaically filled allowed the teacher to just click through using buttons with onclick functions. However, on the student versions of these activiies, inputs are required to procees. These are handled with buttons and onclick funcitons which check the validity of students' answers to each step using GetElementById, GetElementsByClassNames and query.selector functions. The onclick functions also unhide/rehide elements to allow proccessing through the page. Finally, the test pages send the soluiton inputs back into python for checking and, if correct, updating of a database of the logged in student's success. 

Profile: this page shows the students attemps and success in each activity. This is generated by our second sql table: math_activities. On successfull completeion of an activity, python updates the sql database depending on which activity was completed. This is done using post requests
